    "## Homework 08: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due:** Midnight on July 6th, BUT no late points will be charged if you get it in by the last late deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final homework before starting our course project, we will introduce the essential machine learning paradigm of **classification**. We will work with the **UCI Adult** dataset. This is a binary classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ve discussed in this week’s lessons, the classification workflow is similar to what we’ve done for regression, with a few key differences:\n",
    "- We use `StratifiedKFold` instead of plain `KFold` so that every fold keeps the original class proportions.\n",
    "- We use classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for binary classification) instead of regression metrics.\n",
    "- We could explore misclassified instances through a confusion matrix (though we will not do that in this homework).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you’ll build a gradient boosting classification using `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` (HGBC) and explore ways of tuning the hyperparameters, including using the technique of early stopping, which basically avoiding have to tune the number of estimators (called `max_iter` in HGBC). \n",
    "\n",
    "HGBC has many advantages, which we explain below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 graded problems, each worth 7 points, and you get 1 point free if you complete the assignment. "

    "In this problem, you will run a baseline cross-validation evaluation of your `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` pipeline, using `HGBC_model` defined above. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since the Adult dataset is imbalanced (about 24% positives, 76% negatives), accuracy alone is not reliable.\n",
    "* We will use the **F1 score** as the evaluation metric, since it balances precision (avoiding false positives) and recall (avoiding false negatives) in a single measure. This is a fairer metric for imbalanced classification, where both types of error matter.\n",
    "* We will apply **5-fold stratified cross-validation** to make sure each fold has the same proportion of the classes as the original dataset.\n",
    "* Repeated cross-validation is optional and not required here, because the Adult dataset is large and `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is robust to small sampling differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a `StratifiedKFold` cross-validation object with 5 splits, shuffling enabled, and `random_state=random_seed`.\n",
    "2. Use `cross_val_score` to estimate the mean F1 score and its standard deviation across the folds.\n",

    "In this problem, you will explore **Optuna**, a powerful hyperparameter optimization framework, to identify the best combination of hyperparameters that maximize the F1 score of your `pipelined_model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "Optuna uses a smarter sampling strategy than grid search or randomized search, allowing you to explore the hyperparameter space more efficiently. It also supports *pruning*, which can stop unpromising trials early to save time. This makes it a popular SOTA optimization tool.\n",

    "\n",
    "As before, we focus on the **F1 score** because it balances precision and recall, making it more robust on an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define an Optuna objective function to optimize F1 score, sampling the exact same hyperparameter ranges you did in Problem 2 and using the same CV settings.  \n",
    "3. Set up an Optuna study with a reasonable number of trials (e.g., 100–500 depending on runtime resources--on my machine Optuna runs about 10x faster than randomized search for the same number of trials, but YMMV).\n",
    "4. After running the optimization, `display` a clean table with the top 5 trials showing their F1 scores and corresponding hyperparameter settings.\n",
    "5. Answer the graded question. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will take the best hyperparameter configuration you found in your earlier experiments (Randomized Search or Optuna) and fully evaluate the resulting model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "When performing hyperparameter tuning, we typically optimize for a single metric (e.g., F1). However, before deployment, it is essential to check **all relevant metrics** on the final test set to understand the model’s behavior in a balanced way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the best hyperparameters you found in Problems 2 or 3 and apply them to your `pipelined_model`.\n",
    "2. Re-train this final tuned model on the **entire training set** (not just the folds).\n",
    "3. Evaluate the final model on the heldout **test set**, reporting the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Precision\n",
    "   * Recall\n",
    "   * F1 score\n",
    "   * Balanced accuracy\n",
    "4. Use `classification_report` **on the test set** to print precision, recall, and F1 score, and use `balanced_accuracy_score` separately to calculate and print balanced accuracy.\n",
    "5. Answer the graded questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We evaluate the metrics on the test set because it was never seen during training or hyperparameter tuning. This gives us an unbiased estimate of how the model will perform on truly unseen data. Evaluating on the training set would be misleading, because the model has already learned from that data and could appear artificially good.\n"
