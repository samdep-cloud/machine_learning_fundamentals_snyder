    "# Homework 07: Ensemble Methods – Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Due: Midnight on June 30 (with 2-hour grace period) and worth 50 points\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past two weeks, we have expanded our machine learning toolkit by moving beyond linear regression to explore decision trees, which require finding optimal settings for a large set of interacting parameters. Through Homework 6, you developed a systematic workflow for parameter tuning that balances manual exploration and automated searches (e.g., grid search) to optimize performance while gaining insights into model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take another step forward by studying ensemble methods which combine multiple decision trees to produce even stronger predictive models. Specifically, we will investigate **Gradient Boosting,** currently the SOTA among non-deep learning methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Will Do in This Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze and optimize our ensemble models, we will apply the two-phase strategy introduced in Homework 6. However, we will **add two new tools** to our toolbox for tuning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will employ **randomized grid search before exhaustive grid search** to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and identify promising regions without the high computational cost of evaluating every possible combination.\n",
    "- You will **store your best parameter values (and the resulting CV MAE) in a dictionary** in order to track improvements across experiments and maintain a clear record of how each parameter choice was made.  This is essential when doing manual tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our two-phase strategy is thus (with the new features in italics):\n",
    "1. **First Phase:**  \n",
    "   - Iteratively sweep through key parameters in **coarse ranges**, *keeping track of results in a dictionary*  \n",
    "   - Visualize training, validation, and test MAE  \n",
    "   - Diagnose overfitting or underfitting  \n",
    "   - Repeat the iterative sweep with a finer granularity for each parameter (for example, for `n_estimators` you might start with 100, 150,  etc. for the first set of sweeps, then try 125, 150,  ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Phase:**  \n",
    "   - Focus on the most unstable or promising parameter ranges found in Phase 1  \n",
    "   - *Perform a random search within these narrower ranges using `RandomizedSearch`* \n",
    "   - Perform an exhaustive grid search within an even narrower range using `GridSearchCV` with the finest appropriate granularity (e.g., for `n_estimators` it might be 800, 801, 802, ..., 849, 850)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow this process for Gradient Boosting Regressor, systematically tuning the most important parameters (see **Appendix 1** for a complete list):\n",
    " \n",
    "> `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `max_features`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that we will NOT be tuning the learning rate.**  \n",
    "\n",
    ">Gradient Boosting Trees can appear to improve endlessly as you add more and more estimators (and decrease the learning rate correspondingly), however, there is a serious risk of **overfitting**.  There are various ways of controlling this, for example, using Early Stopping, or by keep track of the standard deviation of the CV scores, or by comparing with the test scores, but for the purposes of this homework, we will control overfitting in a naive way by keeping the learning rate fixed at its default value and tuning the other parameters. The point is to focus on the workflow of manual and automated parameter tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue using `RepeatedKFold` cross-validation to reduce variance in our CV MAE estimates. The default number of repetitions is 5, but you may find it necessary to reduce this when initially searching broad parameter spaces—then increase it for fine-tuning as you zero-in on the best models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Starting\n",
    "- Review lesson materials on ensemble methods and pay special attention to the Gradient Boosting video and notebook, as the code in this homework builds on (and has been adapted from) those resources.\n",
    "- Refer to **Appendix 2** for more complete advice about tuning strategies, and **Appendix 3** for an explanation of randomized grid search in Keras and a comparison with exhaustive search.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework consists of 5 graded problems, each worth 10 points, for a total of 50 points."

    "* Start with `range(100, 1001, 100)`\n",
    "* Narrow to `range(800, 1001, 50)`\n",
    "* Refine further with `range(900, 1001, 25)` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Sweeping Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Use 5 repeats for `RepeatedKFold` scoring for stable CV estimates. For broad sweeps, you may reduce to 1–2 repeats to speed up experimentation, but be sure to restore to 5 before finalizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sweep `n_estimators`** (*integer values*):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Test a range of values (e.g., 200 ..., 1000)\n",
    "   * Begin with a step size of 100\n",
    "   * Plot results and update `Parameters_GB` with the value yielding the lowest mean CV MAE\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sweep `max_depth`** (*integer values*):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Test tree depths such as 5, 10, ...\n",
    "   * Use a step size of 5 initially\n",
    "   * Plot results and store the best value in `Parameters_GB`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sweep `max_features`** (*integer values*):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Try integers such as 5, 10, 15...  ('sqrt' and 'log2' are possible, but integers are more precise)\n",
    "   * Start with a step size of 5\n",
    "   * Check `X_train.shape` to see the maximum number of features\n",
    "   * Plot results and store the best value in `Parameters_GB`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sweep '`min_samples_split`** (*integer values*):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Test integers such as 2, 7, 13 ...\n",
    "   * Use a step size of 5 initially\n",
    "   * Plot results and store the best value in `Parameters_GB`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sweep `min_samples_leaf`** (*integer values*):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Try integers such as 1, 6, 11 ...  \n",
    "   * Start with a step size of 5\n",
    "   * Plot results and store the best value in `Parameters_GB`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat with Finer Granularity**\n",
    "   After your first pass, repeat steps 1–5.  I generally repeat it once without changing the range, and then I try it with narrower ranges and smaller step sizes. You don't have to change each parameter each time through. Eventually, you want to end up with fairly narrow ranges with medium-sized steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `n_estimators`: step size of **10** or even **5**\n",
    "   * For the others, a step size of **2** or even **1**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your goal is to home in on the optimal parameter region, using CV MAE  as guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Ensure Robustness**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Your final sweep should use **at least 5 repeats** for `RepeatedKFold`\n",
    "   * This final configuration will form the foundation for Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing 2 - 5 rounds of parameter sweeping:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Report the final tuned values stored in `Parameters_GB`\n",
    "* Display the final **MAE** clearly, in **dollars**\n",
    "* Respond to the associated **graded question**\n"

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Important Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **learning_rate** (default: **0.1**)  \n",
    "   *Controls the contribution of each individual tree. A lower learning rate generally requires more trees but can lead to improved generalization.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **n_estimators** (default: **100**)  \n",
    "   *Specifies the number of boosting stages (i.e., the number of trees in the ensemble). More estimators can improve performance but also increase the risk of overfitting if not tuned properly.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **max_depth** (default: **3**)  \n",
    "   *Limits the depth of the individual regression trees. Restricting the depth helps control overfitting and reduces the complexity of each base learner.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **max_features** (default: **None**)  \n",
    "   *Controls the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Adjusting this can influence the bias-variance trade-off of the model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **min_samples_split** (default: **2**)  \n",
    "   *Defines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. This parameter controls the growth of each tree and can prevent overly specific splits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **min_samples_leaf** (default: **1**)  \n",

    "## Appendix 2: Tuning and Selecting Complex Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This appendix offers practical guidance for tuning complex models like Gradient Boosting and for interpreting validation results to choose the best-performing configuration. It combines strategy, visualization, and decision-making heuristics into one workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using `sweep_parameters` for Single-Parameter Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `sweep_parameters` automates parameter tuning by iterating over a range of values (e.g., `n_estimators`) and tracking performance across:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training MAE**: Fit to training data\n",
    "* **Cross-Validation (CV) MAE**: Generalization estimate across folds (and repeats)\n",
    "* **Test MAE**: Out-of-sample check on a held-out test set\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Interpret the Plots:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training vs. CV MAE**: A growing gap often signals overfitting; high values for both may indicate underfitting.\n",
    "* **CV MAE Curve**: Choose values near the minimum (valley), ideally where the curve flattens.\n",
    "* **Watch Plot Scales**: A flat-looking curve may conceal meaningful differences if the y-axis scale is tight. Always consider actual values, not just shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tuning Strategy: Coarse-to-Fine\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with **broad ranges and coarse steps** (e.g., 100–1000 by 100).\n",
    "* Once you find a promising region, **narrow the range and reduce step size** (e.g., 500–1000 by 25 or 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Using Repeated Cross-Validation Effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Repeat?**\n",
    "Repeated CV provides more stable estimates by averaging results across multiple random folds, reducing variance due to data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Many Repeats?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early (Broad Sweeps):** 1–2 repeats for speed\n",
    "* **Fine Tuning:** 5–10 repeats for stability and confidence in final selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-Offs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* More repeats increase reliability, but also computation time. Scale up only after narrowing your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Model Selection: Key Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing models or parameter settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minimize Mean CV MAE**: This is your primary signal of generalization performance during model tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Look for Stability**: Favor flatter regions (plateaus) near the minimum of the CV MAE curve, rather than sharp dips that may reflect overfitting or noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoid Overfitting**: If you examine the test MAE **after tuning,** be cautious of a *growing gap* between CV MAE and test MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This can suggest the model is fitting cross-validation folds too tightly.\n",
    "  * However, do **not** use test MAE to guide parameter choices — reserve it as a **final check** only.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Optional] Prioritize Consistency**: A lower standard deviation of CV scores indicates more stable performance across different splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpret Plots Carefully**: Always consider the **scale** of the y-axis when comparing curves. Flat-looking trends might conceal meaningful differences if the axis range is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Workflow Tips for Efficient Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visualize Everything**: Always plot training/CV/test MAE of CV scores for insight.\n",
    "* **Track Experiments**: Use a dictionary (or a list of dictionaries) to record parameter settings and results.\n",
    "* **Scale Up Thoughtfully**: Start simple and add complexity (more repeats, finer search) only when needed.\n",
    "* **Use `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` Judiciously**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Start with random search to identify promising regions, then use grid search for final tuning.\n",
    "  * Be aware that both methods may take significant time—especially without a progress bar.\n",
    "* **Enable Parallelism with `n_jobs=-1`**: This will use all available CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If you see warnings (e.g., “a worker stopped”), you may be running out of memory. Reduce `n_jobs` (e.g., to 4) if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining thoughtful parameter sweeps, smart use of repeated CV, and careful reading of validation curves and variance, you’ll build models that not only perform well but generalize reliably.\n"
